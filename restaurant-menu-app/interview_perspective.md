Why I Chose This Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Instead of React)
The project is a simple restaurant menu web app, and vanilla JavaScript was sufficient for dynamic UI updates.
React is great for large-scale applications but adds complexity for a project that doesnâ€™t require heavy state management.
Using vanilla JS ensures better performance for a lightweight project without unnecessary dependencies.

Backend: Node.js (Instead of Other Backend Languages)
Node.js is well-suited for real-time applications like order tracking.
It allows event-driven programming, which helps handle multiple requests simultaneously (e.g., multiple users placing orders).
Since JavaScript is used on both the frontend and backend, it ensures seamless integration and consistency.

Database: MongoDB (Instead of SQL)
The menu and orders have a flexible, schema-less structure, making MongoDB a better choice.
Unlike SQL, MongoDB allows faster reads/writes and is more efficient for applications handling dynamic and hierarchical data (e.g., food items with categories, add-ons, special instructions).
MongoDB scales well with high traffic and real-time data updates (e.g., live order status updates).

Why Not SQL?
SQL databases are great for structured, relational data, but this project deals with dynamic and evolving data models (e.g., new menu items, custom orders, and modifications).
MongoDB simplifies working with nested data (e.g., an order containing multiple food items, each with different quantities).

Why Not Use Another Backend Like PHP or Python?
Node.js integrates smoothly with MongoDB and provides better performance for handling concurrent requests.
Express.js (a Node.js framework) simplifies API development for managing orders, menus, and customers.

Scalability & Future Enhancements
This stack allows future integration with technologies like React, mobile apps, or cloud services without significant refactoring.
Features like real-time order tracking, WebSockets for live updates, and PWA (Progressive Web App) support can be added easily.


SUMMARY (Concise Answer for Interview)

"I chose this stack because it best fits the project requirements. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provide a lightweight and responsive frontend without unnecessary complexity. Node.js is ideal for handling multiple requests and real-time updates efficiently. MongoDB offers a flexible, schema-less database structure, making it easier to manage dynamic data like menu items and orders. While SQL is great for structured data, MongoDB provides faster queries and better scalability for this type of application. If the project grows, we can easily integrate React or expand the backend with additional features."
